# To Do List

This is a simple **To Do List** made with React in a couple of days.
This app is inspired from Clear Todos App.
This app is designed for a mobile view but it work also on desktop screens.
For a better experience turn on the device toolbar for chrome (⌘ ⇧ m)

Datas are saved locally in your `localStorage`.

Use `localStorage.clear()` to clear all your data.

Fell free to fork and edit.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Usage

This app il pretty intuitive.
Use the BIG plus on the right bottom of page to open input.
Write end press ENTER to create task, write again or press again ENTER (on empty input) to exit.
You can also exit click the list or the BIG cross on right bottom corner of your screen.
Each task can be checked by clicking or swiping to right.
